abstract: Gain-dissipative Ising machines (GIMs) are a type of quantum analog
  equipment that can rapidly determine the optimal solution for combinatorial
  optimization problems. When the noise intensity is significantly lower than
  the fixed point of the system, the performance of a GIM is not influenced by
  the fluctuation of the noise intensity. However, the noisec type in previous
  studies is limited to Gaussian white noise. The influence of prevalent colored
  noise on GIMs has not been researched. In this study, the influence of
  common-colored noise on the performance of GIMs is numerically investigated.
  The results of a domain clustering dynamics analysis reveal that red noise can
  better suppress the generation of the noise-induced irregular temporary
  domain. Furthermore, several prevalent MAXCUT problem topologies, including
  the Moebius ladder, random Moebius ladder, and 2D random lattice, are adopted
  as test benchmarks. The results reveal that GIMs influenced by white, blue,
  and violet noise perform better at low-intensity noise condition. In contrast,
  pink and red noise-injected GIMs demonstrate higher performances when applied
  to MAXCUT topologies with both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic connections
  under larger noise intensity conditions. This indicates that the noise
  dispersion can be used as an additional hyperparameter to optimize the
  performance of GIMs.

summary: In this article, we utilize noise dispersion as a hyperparameter to
  modulate the performance of a gain-dissipative Ising machine. The work proves
  the reddening noise can suppress random spin switching, so that the Ising
  machine can better find the ground state. The cover depicts the superior
  performance of red-noise-driven Ising machine in domain clustering dynamics.
