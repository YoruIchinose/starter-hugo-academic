abstract: Superparamagnetic tunnel junctions (STJs) are nanostructures with very
  low turnover barriers. The barrier height of an STJ is generally equal to the
  heat energy at room temperature; thus, it can oscillate automatically without
  external driving. Previous studies have shown that the randomness of an STJ
  can be driven by a subthreshold voltage. This synchronization can be adjusted
  using electrical noise, which is often considered as zero-field Gaussian white
  noise. However, the actual circuit and environment are inevitably associated
  with colored noise, which has not been considered previously. In this work,
  numerical simulations were performed to study the phase-locking
  characteristics of a single STJ with the aid of several typical types of
  colored noise. The results show that the phase-locked behavior of an STJ can
  be effectively enhanced by colored noise whose power spectral density per unit
  of bandwidth is proportional to its frequency. Meanwhile, colored noise whose
  power spectral density per unit of bandwidth and frequency are inversely
  proportional can suppress the synchronization of STJs by suppressing the
  increase in junction frequency.
